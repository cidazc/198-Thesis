\begin{frame}{Abstract}
Genomic data the past few years have grown exponentially with the technology barely keeping up. The problem faced by genome researchers is the large data set and difficulty transferring the files. Previous distributed databases are either not meant for genomic data, or difficult to replicate. This paper lays the groundwork for a distributed database that is designed to easily scale to accommodate bigger storage, and also reduces the data speed bottleneck faced by centralized databases. The proposed system has a master node and data nodes. Data nodes should theoretically increase data transfer speeds even as the number of users increase. (to be updated based on conclusion) While current databases(e.g. NCBI) have more data, more users, and a live platform. The proposed system is aimed towards a smaller community, with more frequent and localized data, which the data storage can easily be expanded as the need arises. The proposed system is also theoretically faster as long as there are multiple working data nodes. A recommendation is to implement the system and make the code public for the use of other communities.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Genomic Concepts}

\begin{frame}{Human DNA Length}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{dna-length.jpg}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Genes}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item all organisms have genes
    \item Genes are made of a certain molecular structure called DNA which correspond to information denoted by: A,G,C,T
    \item Genes are instructions and blueprints for life
  \end{itemize}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.1]{gene-base-pair.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Human Genes}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item There is a lot of information in one human cell
    \item One human cell's entire genes laid out is 2 meters in length \cite{ency_sci_tech} and has $3.2x10^9$ base pairs \cite{introgenomics}
    \item Human body has a lot of information, that when laid out spans the earth to the moon six thousand times
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Genomics}
  \begin{block} {\textbf{Definition of Genomics}}
    Genomics is the study of all of a person's genes (the genome), including interactions of those genes with each other and with the person's environment. \cite{genomics-definition}
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item \textbf{Genomics}: study of whole sets of genes and their interactions \cite{campbell}
    \item More complex organisms have more complex genes (many parts and interactions)
    \item Studying these complex organisms needs a lot of storage
    \item The current online portal mainly used to study this is NCBI \cite{campbell}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Sequencing}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item Reading genes from cells is sequencing
    \item Replications (coverage) \& Fragmentation of DNA is necessary to read
    \item Every read stores the many fragments
    \item Each sequence read is redundant and uses a lot of space
  \end{itemize}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{sequencing.png}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Human Genome Project Successes}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item 2 years after, the project led to a whole genome project for chimpanzees (human's closest relative) \cite{campbell}
    \item These led to many whole genome analysis of organisms (around 4,300 in 2013) \cite{campbell}
    \item Growing amount of research and data from genome research.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Human Genome Project}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item Finished in 2003, project wanted to read the entire human genome
    \item Didn't have the mature tools at the time
    \item Big cost, many institutions, 10 years \cite{introgenomics}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Next Generation Sequencing}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item original sequencing for HGP took ten years, now (2019) one laboratory can do 10,000 a day (36.5 million times faster)  \cite[p.~19]{introgenomics}   
    \item New sequencing technology to read faster and cheaper
    \item Faster reads corresponds to more data
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Megabase means one million bases
\end{itemize}
\centering

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{NGS vs Hard Disk Storage}
        Computational sense, there is a need to store, upload, and retrieve sequence files that are growing larger. 
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Slope of orange line (NGS) is larger than slope of yellow line (pre-NGS)
        \item Hard disk storage (blue) graph is greater than yellow (pre-NGS) but is now less than orange (NGS)
        \end{itemize}
        \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.2]{seq-data.jpeg}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Moore's Law}
  \begin{block}{\textbf{Moore's law}} 
    states that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years.\cite{kurose}
  \end{block}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item Prediction of the speed new technology (faster processing power and better storage) is developed
    \item But moore's law is too slow for the speed of genomic data increase
    \item
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Growing problem of storage}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item Each read\cite{seqtorr} has 60x coverage, around 200gb each
    \item NGS, More genomic researches, more files needed to be saved and transferred
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Data Storage Concepts}
\begin{frame}{Database}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item store data with tech
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
  \begin{frame}{Data Storage}
        A \textbf{database} (\textbf{DBMS}, Database Management System) is defined by 
        \begin{block} {\textbf{Definition}}

        DBMS contains information about a particular enterprise
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Collection of interrelated data
            \item Set of programs to access the data 
            \item An environment that is both convenient and efficient to use
        \end{itemize}
        \cite{Silberschatz2010}
        \end{block}
    \end{frame}
    
    \subsubsection{Database Principles}
    \begin{frame}{Database Principles}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Principles} to remember when creating a database (CAP). Idea is that only 2 of the three can be focused on. \cite[Ch.~19]{Silberschatz2010}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Consistency}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Update one part, will all other (replicated) parts be updated quickly as well
                    \item Data is accurate and copied faithfully
                \end{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Accessibility}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item How easy it is to access data
                    \item API protocols
                \end{itemize}
                \item  \textbf{Partition Tolerance}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item If one portion breaks, the other portions are still usable

    \begin{frame}{P2P: BioTorrents}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Scientific data continues to grow, and so does the demand for easier accessibility
            \item Centralized servers using HTTP or FTP cannot keep up with concurrent requests
            \item Peer-to-peer protocols does not scale well for large files
            \item BitTorrent handles both these problems
        \end{itemize}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{P2P: BioTorrents}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item System for legally sharing scientific data that works on top of the BitTorrent protocol. It is much like a public tracker.
        \item The main website hosts .torrent and metadata files
        \item Info about each dataset includes categories, license, filenames, etc. that helps users in searching for relevant datasets
        \item Torrent file has list of trackers, servers that "know" which peers are serving which files.
        \item Torrent client downloads from multiple peers simultaneously.
        \item To upload a torrent, the client makes a .torrent file using the torrenting software, then uploads it to the main website along with metadata. The client must have their computer continuously turned on to keep the file available as a peer. \cite{biotorrents}

    \begin{frame}{P2P: BioTorrents}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item As with all public trackers, BioTorrents requires "good souls" that will keep many torrents available as often as possible.
            \item The datasets must be moderated to prevent abuse.
            \item The BioTorrents website is no longer up.

    \subsection{PeerDB}
    \begin{frame}{P2P: PeerDB}
    % try adding screenshots
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Proposed P2P system for sharing general data
            \item Each node is equipped with a database
            \item Queries are passed around neighbors, with a maximum number of hops
            \item Caches information about other peers to speed up queries
            \item Large number of nodes \& relatively small number of lookup servers
            \cite{peerdb}
        \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Distributed Database}
    \begin{frame}{Distributed Databases}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Distributed Database}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item A distributed database system consists of loosely coupled sites that share no physical component             
                \item Database systems that run on each site are independent of each other
                \item Transactions may access data at one or more sites
                \cite[Ch.~19]{Silberschatz2010}
                \item Beneficial for large data with a certain speed requirement
            \end{itemize}

    \subsection{SeqTorr}
    \begin{frame}{Distributed: SeqTorr}
    \textbf{SeqTorr} \cite{seqtorr}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Standard genomics workflow consists of uploading and downloading data on an international database like NCBI.
        \item Having a distributed scalable local infrastructure to store genomic data instead of relying on NCBI would be beneficial since
        \begin{itemize}
            \item only certain sequences in NCBI are relevant to the institutions (e.g. Asian sequences are needed more than Caucasian ones)
            \item researchers within the country can share data with fast speeds
            \item institutions can share in the hosting of data

        \item Data node
        \begin{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item For the framework, the system should have the main API’s 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item POST genome data
        \item GET genome data (this will implement a hybrid P2P transfer)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item This will aim to speed up number 3 in the Problems of Classical Databases
        \end{itemize}
        \item PUT genome metadata (optional: PUT data)
        \item DELETE genome data
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Scope}
\begin{frame}{Scope}
The current scope and coverage of the project is only
\begin{itemize}
    \item To create a framework for a proposed system
    \item To design the correctness of a system
    \item To look at the basic time complexity of the base system (NCBI) and the proposed system
    \item To compare the proposed system to the base system
\end{itemize}

The current scope and coverage of the project will NOT consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Security and Authentication 
    \item Specific technologies to create the system
    \item All the data stored in the system (but focus on main data only)

         \textbf{Networks Layers} how computers pass data to each other
        \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Level 1: Medium used to send signals (physical, electrical signals of 0 and 1), through wire or by air
                    \item Level 2: Introduction of packets: Wifi, Ethernet, connecting together different interfaces. Goal of sending a group of signals.
                    \item Level 3: Introduction of networks: IP Address to uniquely identify entities.
                    \item Level 4: Management of error free data transmission: Sending a group of messages via TCP, UDP, FTP
                    \item Level 5: Abstraction of Level 4: Function calls programmers will use to do level 4 processes.

    \begin{frame}{Application Architecture}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \textbf{application architecture} is how a networked app is structured across the various end systems (i.e. computers, servers, etc.) \cite{kurose}
            \item Falls into either client-server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architecture
        \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Client-Server}
        \begin{frame}{Client-Server}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item A \textbf{client-server} architecture relies on a Web server that is always available and has a fixed IP address\\
                \item A single server connects to many clients
            \end{itemize}

        \subsubsection{Peer-to-Peer \& Hybrid}
        \begin{frame}{Peer-to-Peer \& Hybrid}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item A \textbf{peer-to-peer (P2P)} architecture has minimal to no reliance on always-on, dedicated servers
                \item Peers are desktops/laptops that communicate to each other without passing through a dedicated server
                \item A \textbf{hybrid} architecture combines elements of P2P and client-server architectures, attempting to utilize advantages of both

                \item \textbf{Peers} are users that connect to the BitTorrent network.
                \item \textbf{Torrent files} contain metadata about files \& folders, trackers, and hash values.
                \item \textbf{Trackers} are servers that keep track of peers and availability of files
                \item \textbf{Seeds} are peers which have downloaded the entire file and are making it available
            \end{itemize}
        \end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Theoretical Framework: System Description}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{master node} stores metadata of all sequences, may or may not contain sequence files
        \item \textbf{Data nodes} stores sequence files \& metadata of all sequence files in its filesystem
        \item Both master node \& data nodes have user interface that allow users to upload, search, and download sequence files

\subsection{Community}
\begin{frame}{Community}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item Community may add their own data
    \item Community may increase their data storage capacity
    \item Community may increase data transfer speeds (through data nodes)
    \item Frequently used data can become more accessible
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Comparisons}
\begin{frame}{Speed Comparisons}

Variables used:
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item \textbf{H} - Constant overhead before downloading may occur
    \item \textbf{X} - Constant data transfer speed by the server in bytes per second
    \item \textbf{N} - Number of users simultaneously using the system at the same time
  \end{itemize}
  
Assumptions used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item constant data transfer
    \item equal division of bandwidth
    \item all users are getting the same data as once
    \item there is a constant overhead before downloading the data for each user
    \item there is also an equal division of the data nodes' bandwidth to the users
    \item and all data nodes have an exact copy of the data.
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Speed Comparisons Algorithm}
Algorithm for the base method:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a constant overhead H seconds to set up the communication between the user and the main server.
    \item The main server sends data in the speed of X bytes per second. X is the speed of data transfer from the server.
    \item Users will receive the data with an equal portion of the X bytes per second (bandwidth).
    \end{enumerate}
    
Algorithm for the proposed method:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item There is a constant overhead H seconds to set up the communication between the user and the relevant nodes.
    \item All data nodes (D number of data nodes) will send data in the speed of D times X bytes per second. X is the speed of data transfer from 1 data node.
    \item Users will receive data with an equal portion of the D times X bytes per second.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Speed Comparisons Conclusions}
    
Generally as the number of users increases, the data transfer speed decreases by a constant factor for all methods. There is also a concept of \textbf{bottleneck} when the number of users is much greater than the data speed put out by all methods.

The proposed method (with D $>$ 1, and same H, X, N) will be faster than the base method. \textit{With this analysis, it is suggested the proposed method is faster than the base method on most cases (D $>$ 1). }
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Final Comparisons}
  \begin{block} {\textbf{Base Method: NCBI}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The current base method (NCBI) is the go-to website for biological data and genomic data. 
        \item One website and one server. This points to a single point of failure\cite{seqtorr}.
        \item The section on theoretical analysis of speed described the problem of having a bottleneck when the number of users are too many for the data bandwidth of the server. 
    \end{itemize}

  \end{block}
  
    \begin{block} {\textbf{Proposed Method: caDDS}}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item With multiple data nodes, this is faster in theory than the base method.
        \item  Community: \begin{itemize}
            \item Database only contains community used data
            \item Frequently used data can be made more accessible
            \item The design and principles of the database may be calibrated to the needs of a community
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Recommendations}
  \begin{itemize}   
    \item Implement the proposed system
    \item Pay attention to port problems with university internet
    \item Discuss and mitigate different security risks
    \item Find a way to connect master nodes to other master nodes
    \item Abstract the data to non-genomic data, for use in other scientific fields
